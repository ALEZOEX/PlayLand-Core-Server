}
```

#### 🔧 Measurable Improvements:
- **TPS-based optimization**: Compression level 1-9 with automatic adjustment for low TPS
- **Latency-aware compression**: High latency (>100ms) prioritizes compression, low latency (<20ms) prioritizes speed
- **Player count scaling**: >100 players increases compression, <10 players reduces overhead
- **Memory protection**: >80% memory usage disables pattern analysis and real-time optimization
- **Packet size optimization**: 32-256 byte minimum packet size based on performance
- **Compression threshold**: 40-95% threshold adjustment based on network conditions

### 🧪 Enhanced Testing Framework - Round 8
