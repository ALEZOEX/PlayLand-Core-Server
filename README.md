## 🛠️ Building PlayLand

### Prerequisites
- **Java 21** (required)
- **Git** (for patch system)
- **Windows** (scripts provided for Windows, adapt for other OS)

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/PlayLandMC/PlayLand-Core-Server.git
cd PlayLand-Core-Server

# Build the server (Windows)
build.bat

# Or use Gradle directly
./gradlew applyPatches build
```

### Build Scripts

#### `build.bat` - Main Build Script
The primary build script with multiple options:
1. **Full build** - Complete clean build with patches
2. **Quick build** - Fast build without cleaning
3. **Clean build** - Clean build without patches
4. **Patches only** - Apply patches without building

#### `scripts/apply-patches.bat`
Applies all PlayLand patches to create the Paper fork:
- Sets up upstream Paper
- Applies branding patches
- Applies optimization patches
- Applies vanilla mechanics patches

#### `scripts/make-patches.bat`
Creates patches from your modifications:
- Generates patch files from changes
- Validates patch application
- Tests clean patch application

#### `scripts/update-upstream.bat`
Updates to the latest Paper version:
- Backs up current patches
- Updates upstream Paper
- Attempts to apply existing patches
- Handles conflicts gracefully
